# readiscord
for those people with hoofdaphobia! (or you don't like uppercase..)

this is a fork of the [reavision](https://github.com/Commenter25/userstuffs/blob/main/raevision/raevision.user.css?raw=1) userstyle thing for browsers (which makes everything lowercase, woah!)
you can now ignore your friends scream at you because thats mean!!

## vencord (:p)
go to `https://github.com/soswav/readiscord/blob/main/readiscord.css`, click on `raw` then copy the link of the page
go to `themes` then `online themes` and paste it below

## other discord modifiers
download the `https://github.com/soswav/readiscord/blob/main/readiscord.css` and paste in  your themes folder, it should (hopefully) work nicely!

## super cool gamer way
### download git 
#### on linux:
##### on debian/ubuntu use `sudo apt install git`
##### on arch use `sudo pacman -S git`
##### on fedora use `sudo dnf install git`

#### on windows:
go to `https://git-scm.com/` and download it, make sure to click on something with "path" (so you can use command "git")

#### on macos:
figure it out

### installing it

after installing git you can finally run

`git clone https://github.com/soswav/readiscord/` then go to the directory and copy the readiscord.theme.css file and paste it on your themes folder

shortcut for windows users: `git clone https://soswav/readiscord/ && copy /path/to/clone /path/to/themes`

or for linux users, `git clone https://github.com/soswav/readiscord/ && cp ~/readiscord/readiscord.css /path/to/themes/`

todo list:
add a uppercase option (never)
