## super cool gamer way
### download git 
#### on linux:
##### on debian/ubuntu use `sudo apt install git`
##### on arch use `sudo pacman -S git`
##### on fedora use `sudo dnf install git`

#### on windows:
go to [whatever search engine you use](https://4get.ca) and find it, then download it and then make sure to click on something with "path" (so you can use command "git")

### final step for sueper cool gmaer way

after installing git you can finally run

windows: `git clone https://soswav/readiscord/ && copy /path/to/clone /path/to/themes`
linux: `git clone https://github.com/soswav/readiscord/ && cp ~/readiscord/readiscord.css ~/.var/app/dev.vencord.Vesktop/config/VencordDesktop/VencordDesktop`
