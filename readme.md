# installation methodss sss ssss s
## vencord
go to `(https://github.com/soswav/readiscord/blob/main/readiscord.css`, click on `raw` then copy the link of the page

go to `themes` then `online themes` and paste it below

## other discord modifiers
download the `https://github.com/soswav/readiscord/blob/main/readiscord.css` and paste in  your themes folder, it should (hopefully) work nicely!

## super cool gamer way
### download git 
#### on linux:
##### on debian/ubuntu use `sudo apt install git`
##### on arch use `sudo pacman -S git`
##### on fedora use `sudo dnf install git`

#### on windows:
go to [whatever search engine you use](https://4get.ca) and find it, then download it and then make sure to click on something with "path" (so you can use command "git")

### final step for sueper cool gmaer way

after installing git you can finally run

on windows: `git clone https://github.com/soswav/readiscord/ && copy /path/to/clone /path/to/themes`

on linux: `git clone https://github.com/soswav/readiscord/ && cp ~/readiscord/readiscord.css ~/.var/app/dev.vencord.Vesktop/config/VencordDesktop/VencordDesktop && sudo rm -r ~/readiscord`

`cp` will copy the file from the cloned folder to the vesktop flatpak themes folder

`&&` will run the other command if the previous command was successful

and `sudo rm -r` will remove the cloned folder as root (so you don't need to confirm)

alt for linux users if you don't want to use sudo

`curl -O https://github.com/soswav/readiscord/readiscord.css && mv ~/readiscord.css ~/.var/app/dev.vencord.Vesktop/config/VencordDesktop/VencordDesktop`
